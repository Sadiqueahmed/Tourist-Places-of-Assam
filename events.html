      <h5>Bihu</h5>
      <p>Bihu is the essence of Assam and is celebrated across the state with a tremendous zeal and enthusiasm. There are three Bihu festivals namely ‘Bohag Bihu’ celebrated in the month of ‘Bohag’ (Baisakh, the middle of April), ‘Magh Bihu’ celebrated in the month of ‘Magh’ (the middle of January), and ‘Kati Bihu’ celebrated in the month of ‘Kati’ (Kartik, the middle of October). Each of the Bihu festival has its own significance and is celebrated with its own traditions.

        The Bohag Bihu, also called the Rongali Bihu is a festival of merriment and heralds the Assamese New Year and the onset of spring. The first day of the Bohag Bihu is called Goru Bihu. Bulls and cows are bathed with turmeric, fed with gourds and brinjals and provided with new attaching ropes. The second day of the Rongali Bihu festival (the first day of the Assamese New Year) is called the Manuh Bihu. Men, women and children put on new clothes, special dishes are prepared at every home for feasts, Pitha’s of various kinds are the pre requites. It is a day of merriment and festivity. People visit their friends and relatives with food items and gifts. The close relatives and friends are also gifted with hand-woven scarves called ‘Gamucha’ as an honorary felicitation.</p>

    <h5>Me-Dum-Me-Phi</h5>
    <p>Literally in Me-Dum-Me-Phi, ‘Me’ means Worship, ‘Dam’ means the Dead and ‘Phi’ means God. According to the Tai Ahom faith, man is not reborn after death and as such one of the important customs among them is that the dead body is not burnt but kept in a box and a ‘‘Maidam’’ is built.The essence of this festival is that the ancestors or the dead ones are worshipped by the family members so that the deceased is elevated to the position of ‘Phi’ or God. Even though Me-Dam-Me-Phi is celebrated throughout Assam, celebrations in the districts of Sivasagar, Dibrugarh and Lakhimpur are popular owing to the higher Tai Ahoms concentration in these areas. At present, the Ahom people observe Me-Dum-Me-Phi on the 31st of January each year and the same has been declared as a public holiday by the Government of Assam recognizing the importance of the day.

      <p>The Ali-Ai-Ligang Festival is celebrated by the Mishing tribe every year with much enthusiasm as it marks the onset of New Year for the tribe. The word ‘Ali’ denotes root, ‘Ai’ stands for fruit and ‘Ligang’ means sowing. So, the festival name basically denotes harvest and this is the reason why, the sowing in of paddy is started on this day ritually. Dresses in traditional attires, the Mishing people pay respect to their ancient God ‘Donyi-Polo’ for prosperity and harvest by offered eggs and fish during this festival. The Ali Ai Ligang Festival in Assam is celebrated during the spring season. It is held every year on the first Wednesday of the month of ‘Ginmur Polo’ or February-March. The festival continues for 5 days.

        The festival is marked by sowing of paddy seeds. After this part of ceremony, young girls and boys of the tribe take part in ‘Gumrag’ dance. After the dancing part gets over, a grand community feast is held by the participants. The food includes treats like ‘Poro Aapong’ or rice beer, dried fish and pork. ‘Purang Apin’ (packed boiled rice) is specially prepared by the Misings only for the festival. During this festival, certain taboos are purely observed with respect to cutting trees, ploughing, fishing, burning jungles etc as per ancient rituals.</p>

      <h5>Ambubashi Mela</h5>
      <p>The temple is one of 51 Shaktipeeths or seat of Shakti followers, each representing a body part of the Sati, Lord Shiva’s companion. The temple’s sanctum sanctorum houses the yoni — female genital — symbolised by a rock. Ambubashi Mela witnesses thousands of tantriks and sadhus in attendance from across the world, displaying their psychic powers making an extraordinary spectacle. It is believed that the Goddess goes through her menstrual cycle every year in the month of June. All the temples in Assam including the Kamakhya Temple are closed during those days and no religious activities are performed. After three days, the Goddess is bathed and other rituals are performed. On the fourth day, the doors of the temple are reopened and prasad in the form of ‘Angodak’ and ‘Angabastra’ is distributed. ‘Angodak’ means the fluid part of the body which is basically water from the spring. While the ‘Angabastra’ also called as ‘Rakta Bastra’ which is cloth soaked in the menses of the Goddess.

        The Ambubashi Mela is celebrated every year during the monsoon season, which happens to fall in around the middle of the month of June. Thus, every year during the time of Ambubashi a large number of devotees gather here to perform religious rituals. </p>
