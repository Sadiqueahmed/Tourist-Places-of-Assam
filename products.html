            Carved from blocks of wood, "Kolam masks"
            are brightly painted with unique patterns of colors
            based on sex, age, and position in society. In addition to these types of
              Kolam masks, there is another group that are used by village shaman
              to treat various birth defects and diseases. These kinds look grotesque.

          <h5>Black Pepper (Ceylon Pepper)</h5>
          <p>In Sri Lanka, pepper or the woody perennial evergreen climbing vine, Piper nigrum, is cultivated over an area of 32800 hectares and majorly in the districts of Matale, Kandy, Kegalle, and Kurunegala where it’s grown either as a mono-crop or a mixed crop in coconut and tea plantations using live or dead stands as support. It’s also ideal for home gardens.
  
            Today, pure origin pepper enjoys a huge demand internationally, and the public is keener to discover spices that originate from a specific “terroir” just like wines. Ceylon Pepper is mainly exported to India, Germany and the USA and enjoys a growing demand from Australia and Canada.

        <h5>Gems</h5>
        <p>Sri Lanka is well known throughout the world for the large quantity and exquisite variety of its gemstones. These gemstones occur mainly in alluvial gravels found in valley bottoms into which flow tributary hillside streams which carry gem minerals released by weathering form the bed rock sources located at hilltops or hillsides. Apart from the sedimentary formation which carry gemstones some rocks too have been shown to contain gemstones particularly varieties of Corundum. There are also gemstones associated with pegmatite which constituted an important source.
  
          During early times Sri Lanka was once quite fittingly referred to as “Rathna-dweepa” which connotes the meaning “The Island of Gemstones”. The name Rathna-dveepa is found in many chronicles. A Merchants Guide “Periplus of the Erythrean Sea” presumed to have been complied during the first century.</p>

          <h5>Pottery</h5>
          <p>The key requirement of a vessel is always to serve the purpose it is designed for. Sri Lankan potters create their unique products with the use of equipment that is specially built for pottery. Traditional water-storing vessels designed by these creators such as Kalagediya and Gurulettuwa have a spherical shape with a wide inner space to store water. The clay used to make these vessels absorbs and removes the organic and inorganic contaminants from drinking water. Therefore, some of these vessels are used today in the same form while some have transformed to serve the suit modern lifestyle while delivering the same advantage to the user.
  
            Clay-based cooking pots that are used in traditional cooking still play an important role in the local kitchen. Potters keep these pots in the sun to dry for a few days after they are being shaped or they burn these pots in a kiln to make them hard and brittle. As a result, these pots are not damaged by the hours they get to spend on the fire.</p>

        <h5>Batik Clothes</h5>
        <p> The Batik industry in Sri Lanka is a small scale industry which can employ individual design talent and creativity. Its economic benefit is profit from dealing with foreign customers. It is now the most visible of the island's crafts with galleries and factories, large and small, having sprung up in many tourist areas. Rows of small stalls selling batiks can be found all along Hikkaduwa's Galle Road strip. Mahawewa, on the other hand, is famous for its batik factories.
  
          Batiks incorporate many motifs and colours, some traditional, others highly contemporary and individual. Many display a vigorousness of design related to their origin. The material created by the batik-makers is used to produce distinctive dresses, shirts, sarongs and beachwear well-suited for tropical climes. Many tourists at seaside resorts such as Hikkaduwa wear batik clothes throughout their holiday. Apart from clothes, tablecloths, wall pictures, beach clothes, pure cotton and silk, men's and ladies' wear and bed covers are popular as a reminder of a visit to Sri Lanka.</p>

          <h5>Ancient Wall Paintings At Sigirya</h5>
          <p>King Kashyapa reigned with an iron fist during the 5 th Century AD, and it certainly shows in the artistic creations that adorn the walls of Sigiriya. It is believed that the king wanted Sigiriya to emulate the fabled Alakamanda, the city of gods, a feat the ancient craftsmen possibly achieved, based on the remains we can see today. <br> <br>
            The walls of Sigiriya are believed to have originally been plastered and painted white to convey the idea of purity, similar to the manner in which the city of gods was depicted in the ancient world. But Kashyapa was more intent on creating a magnificent spectacle that would stand out and capture the attention of anyone who visited the citadel. </p>

          <h5>Traditional Sri lankan Kandy (udarata ) Dancer</h5>
          <p> Kandyan dance encompasses various dance forms popular and native to the area called Kandy of the Central Hills region known as Udarata in Sri Lanka, which have today spread to other parts of the country. It is an example of Sinhalese culture in Sri Lanka. Even though originally only males were allowed to train as dancers, there are now several schools that also train women in the Kandyan dance form. However, there is no definite Ves costume for women, and many female dancers have adapted the male costume in different ways.
  
            There are only a few performances of the Kohomba Kankariya now due to many social, economic and political reasons. The dance in its traditional form is still performed each year at the Dalada Perhahera in Kandy.</p>

        <h5>Wooden architecture and wood-carving</h5>
        <p>Wooden architecture and wood-carving are inextricably linked in the traditional wooden architecture of Sri Lanka, especially in Kandy, the central province of the country. The allied skills simultaneously highlight the construction and carving skills of master-craftsmen and architects; Kandyan wooden architecture is extremely rich in detailing, show-casing a range of wood-carving, much of which represents a remarkable combination of creativity and skill in manipulating the material.
          The abundance of several varieties of timber was instrumental in the prolific presence of wooden architecture. Owing to its durability and hardness, timber was used to make several structural components like beams and massive pillars, as also elaborately designed doors and windows. The traditional craft of wood-carving was practised by several highly esteemed crfatsmen and master-craftsmen, who trained apprentices in the principles of the craft.</p>
