          <p>"Kolam" is a dance drama of rural Sri Lanka. Just like several other names for theatre traditions of south Asia, kolam refers to disguise and mimicry. The actors wear masks and costumes and perform with mime, dance and some dialogue.
            Carved from blocks of wood, "Kolam masks"
            are brightly painted with unique patterns of colors
            based on sex, age, and position in society. In addition to these types of
              Kolam masks, there is another group that are used by village shaman
              to treat various birth defects and diseases. These kinds look grotesque.

A fully grown clove tree is about 15-20 metres tall and has smooth grey bark. Ceylon Clove is notably richer in oil than the clove varieties produced elsewhere in the world.

          <h5>Black Pepper (Ceylon Pepper)</h5>
          <p>In Sri Lanka, pepper or the woody perennial evergreen climbing vine, Piper nigrum, is cultivated over an area of 32800 hectares and majorly in the districts of Matale, Kandy, Kegalle, and Kurunegala where it’s grown either as a mono-crop or a mixed crop in coconut and tea plantations using live or dead stands as support. It’s also ideal for home gardens.
  
            Today, pure origin pepper enjoys a huge demand internationally, and the public is keener to discover spices that originate from a specific “terroir” just like wines. Ceylon Pepper is mainly exported to India, Germany and the USA and enjoys a growing demand from Australia and Canada.

          <h5>Muga Silk</h5>
          <p>Nestled among the blue hills and green valley lies the state of Assam-the gateway to North East India.  Situated in the foothills of the Himalayas and on the banks of the mighty Brahmaputra, Assam is also renowned for its wild silk production along with the quintessential tea gardens. Silk rearing and weaving dates back to centuries in Assam making it an integral part of its culture. Almost every village in Assam is host to generations of silk producing communities.   </p>

        <h5>Eri Silk</h5>
        <p>Eri silk yarn has some unique properties hence why it is known as an all-weather fibre. The Isothermal properties of Eri silk makes it cool in summer and its thermal properties make it warm in winter. The process of producing Eri silk yarns and fibres in the villages has the smallest carbon footprint in the world in the textile industry.

          Another unique factor is that all activities from rearing of the silkworms to weaving happens within a village ecosystem. Unlike other textile fibres Eri silk production resembles a model of a circular economy.
          
          Eri silk is mostly used in weaving in India’s Northeast region, but has great potential in knitting, crochet, and embroidery. Due to its staple (short) fibre makeup requiring it to be spun and not reeled. In addition it has a woolly texture or a cotton-like behaviour and is heavier than other silks.</p>

          <p>Assam tea is a black tea named after Assam, India, the region of its production. It is manufactured specifically from the plant Camellia sinensis var. assamica (Masters).[1][2] The Assam tea plant is indigenous to Assam—initial efforts to plant the Chinese varieties in Assam soil did not succeed.[3][4] Assam tea is now mostly grown at or near sea level and is known for its body, briskness, malty flavour, and strong, bright colour. Assam teas, or blends containing Assam tea, are often sold as "breakfast" teas. For instance, Irish breakfast tea, a maltier and stronger breakfast tea, consists of small-sized Assam tea leaves.[</p>

          <h5>CANE AND BAMBOO</h5>
          <p>Cane and bamboo have remained inseparable parts of life in Assam. Grown in abundance here and hence most of the household articles in the homes of Assamese are made of cane and bamboo. They happen to be the two most commonly-used items in daily life, ranging from household implements to construction of dwelling houses to furniture to weaving accessories to musical instruments.

            The Jappi, the traditional sunshade continues to be the most prestigious of bamboo items of the state, and it has been in use since the days when the great Chinese traveller Hiuen Tsang came to Assam that visitors are welcomed with a jaapi. </p>

        <h5>METAL CRAFTS</h5>
        <p>Bell-metal and brass have been the most commonly used metals for the Assamese artisan. Traditional utensils and fancy artiicles designed by these artisans are found in every Assamese household. The Xorai and bota have in use for centuries, to offer betel-nut and paan while welcoming distinguished guests.

          The entire population of two townships near Guwahati - Hajo and Sarthebari, are engaged in producing traditional bell-metal and brass articles. They have also used their innovative skills to design modern day articles to compete with the changing times.
          
          Gold, silver and copper too form a part of traditional metal craft in Assam and the State Museum in Guwahati has a rich collection of items made of these metals. Gold however is now used only for ornaments.</p>

          <h5>WOOD CRAFT</h5>
          <p> Assam has always remained one of the most forest-covered states of the country, and the variety of wood and timber available here have formed a part of the people's culture and ecomony.

            An Assamese can identify the timber by touching it even in darkness, and can produce a series of items from it. While decorative panels in the royal Ahom palaces of the past and the 600-years old satras or Vaishnative monasteries are intricately carved on wood, a special class of people who excelled in wood carving came to be known as Khanikar, a surname proudly passed down from generation to generation.
            
            The various articles in a satra and naam-ghar(place of worship) are stiff cut on wood, depicting the guru asana (pedestal of the lords), apart from various kinds of birds and animals figuring in mythology.
            
            Modern-day Khanikar have taken to producing articles of commercial values, including figures of one-horned rhino and replicas of the world-famous Kamakhya temple - two items heading the list of demands of a visitor from outside.</p>

        <h5>JEWELLERY</h5>
        <p>Gold-washing and jewellery-making were two important ancient industries in Assam. The earliest references to the golden art are found in the Arthashastra, but jewellery-making on an elaborate scale happened during the Ahom reign. Goldsmiths and gold traders flourished in Kamrup, Goalpara, Barpeta and Sivasagar but Jorhat town and outlying areas became the nerve centre of the gold and silver craft for superior enamelling work known as minakari in Assamese.

          Dark blue, dark green and white were the preferred enamelling, but red and yellow were used occasionally. Crafting traditional Assamese ornaments is a painstaking process but the end products are a breathtaking range of ornaments. Necklaces carry names like Jonbiri, Dholbiri and Dugdugi while Lokaparo, Thuria and Dighal Keru are popular ear-rings. The rings have names like Patia Angathi and Babari Phulia Angathi while a variety of bracelets include Gam Kharu, Baju and Kangkan</p>

          <h5>TERRACOTTA</h5>
          <p> Two categories of people – Kumars and Hiras – made pottery their own. But the ones that carved out a niche are the terra cotta craftsmen of Asarikandi in Dhubri district. The distinctive style has made Asarikandi an ethnic art brand in India. Asarikandi is also known for its sola pith craft, made from the soft core of a special kind of reed. Terracotta as a medium has dominated the handicraft scene of Assam since time immemorial. The tradition itself has been handed down from the generation to generation without break. Today we have the descendent of such families engaged in improvised terracotta versions of various common figures of gods and goddesses to mythological characters, while toys, vases, etc have also found a new life.</p>

        <h5>TRADITIONAL PAINTINGS</h5>
        <p>The tradition of paintings in Assam can be traced back to several centuries in the past. Ahom palaces and satras and naam-ghar etc still abound in brightly-coloured paintings depicting various stories and events from history and mythology. In fact, the motifs and designs contained in Chitra-Bhagavata have come to become a traditional style for Assamese painters of the later period, and are still in practice today.</p>
